# Bayesian-approach-to-regression-and-machine-learning
This project explores three different methods to perform regression on data using Python. The implementation demonstrates diverse approaches to modeling and predicting data, combining traditional statistical methods with Bayesian techniques and numerical simulations.

## Features

# 1. **Least Squares Regression**  
   Implements a regression model by minimizing the squared error. A custom class is created to fit and predict data, ensuring scalability and reusability.  

# 2. **Bayesian Linear Regression**  
   Uses Bayesian principles with prior and posterior distributions. The prior model assumes a Gaussian distribution, enabling the computation of posterior distributions analytically.  

# 3. **Numerical Bayesian Regression with MCMC**  
   Implements Bayesian regression using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to numerically estimate posterior distributions. Histograms are generated to represent these distributions visually.  
## Technologies and Tools

### Languages and librarys
**Python**  
   Primary programming language used for all implementations.  

- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
   For interactive development and visualization of results.  

- **NumPy**  
   Used for efficient numerical computations.  

- **Matplotlib**  
   For visualizing data, regression results, and posterior distributions.  

- **Pandas**  
   For data handling and preprocessing.  

- **Corner**  
   Used to generate corner plots of the posterior distributions from the MCMC sampler.
